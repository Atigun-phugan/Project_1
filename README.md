## Problem Statement
**H1: What is the relationship between SAT scores (total) and participation over the 3 years (2017–2019)? H2: Among the 51 states n the USA, does the requirement for all students to take the SAT affect the scores compared to states where the test is not required?**

# Background
The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math (source). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section (source). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):

# Outside Research
I found additional data to support my hypothesis that the composite SAT score negatively impacts the correlation results. Specifically, I found that seven states in the U.S.—Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island—require all students to take the exam. Data from (source1)., (source2),(source3)

# Executive Summary
This analysis investigates the relationship between SAT scores and participation across the 51 states in the USA over three academic years (2017-2019). The primary focus is on determining whether the requirement for all students to take the SAT impacts overall scores compared to states where participation is not mandatory. Data was gathered from SAT participation rates and scores for each state, highlighting variations and potential influencing factors.

# Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusions: The data suggests a complex relationship between SAT scores and participation rates. In certain states, high participation did not correlate with high scores, indicating that mandatory testing policies may lead to lower average scores when the student population includes a broader range of academic preparedness. Conversely, states with selective participation (where only college-bound students take the test) tended to achieve higher average scores.

# Recommendations: 
States should consider a mixed approach to participation, allowing for voluntary testing for students not pursuing college while providing resources to support those who are preparing for college. Increased focus on educational resources and preparation programs can improve scores, particularly in states with mandatory participation, ensuring that all students are equipped to perform well on the SAT.
